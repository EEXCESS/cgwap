# CGWAP - A Cultural Game With A Purpose
This question & answering game engages players with the tremendous collection of European cultural heritage objects in [Europeana](http://www.europeana.eu "Europeana").

Players can pose questions that are answered by Europeana
resources. When posing a question, the asking player needs
to provide the correct answers as URLs to Europeana resources. Other players can then try to answer the question by searching via an interface to Europeana.

## Live Demo
A live demo of the game is available at http://mics.fim.uni-passau.de/CGWAP/

## Installation instructions:
CGWAP requires an instance of the Apache Tomcat Web Server with a Java Runtime Environment version 7 or higher and a PostgreSQL database (version 9.0).  
The database connection settings and credentials can be specified in WEB-INF/config.properties.  
Afterwards, the WAR file can be deployed as usual.

## Rationale for game mechanics
The concept, ideas and rationale for the game mechanics and design choices are explained in more detail in "A Game with a Purpose to Access Europe's Cultural Treasure", J. Schl√∂tterer, C.Seifert, L. Wagner and M. Granitzer (to appear in GamifIR '15, link will be added after publication).
